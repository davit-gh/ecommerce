# Bitcoin Payments 
Website leverages blockchain.info's [Receive Payments API V2](https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive) for accepting bitcoin payments. Follow the instructions on the linked page to sign up for a wallet, request an API key and find out your XPUB. You then need to copy over those values into your “local_settings.py” file.
